# SPR Detector Firmware

This firmare is used by the Surface Plasmon Resonance Detector. This detector could engineer the system so that the SPR phenomenon can occur and be observed. 

Some features that it has are the following:
- Turning the laser on and off
- Moving the laser to a specific direction and angle
- Capturing images using a camera and sending the captured images to the GUI
- Performing SPR angle detection that yields the SPR curve.

This device can be integrated with a [GUI](https://github.com/kemalrizky/spr-detector-gui) app for controlling the device and visualize the acquired data. It uses HTTP protocol to communicate with the GUI app.
